===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).


# Jumper Game

This game is basically a simplified Frogger clone.  The goal is to get to or above 200 points with points being awarded for moving on the street or making it to the water and points being taken away for running into one of the bugs driving down the street.

## Installation

Download the GitHub repository and copy the files to a web server with the directory structure intact.

## Usage

Browse to the index.html within the root directory of wherever you placed the files within the web server.

## Playing the game

First, select the player you want from the dropdown list at the bottom of the screen.  Once selected, click on the Start! button.  Now control your player with the arrow keys on the keyboard.  Play in the street while avoiding the bugs to score some points.  Reaching the water awards even more points.  Getting hit by a bug will cost points.  Reach 200 (or more) points to win the game!

I highly recommend you go through the Udacity course and write your own from scratch.  Don't touch mine.
